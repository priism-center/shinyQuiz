shinyquiz is an R package for creating simple, flexible quizzes within R Shiny. Easily create quizzes from various pre-built question and choice types or create your own using [htmltools](https://rstudio.github.io/htmltools/) and [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) packages as building blocks. Integrates with Shiny applications. Ideal for non-web-developers such as educators, data scientists, and anyone who wants to assess responses interactively in a small form factor.

shinyquiz is excellent for developing short, informal quizzes with a priority of showing one question at a time. At the end of each question, users are notified if their answer is correct. Once the quiz ends, a summary page shows the user's grade, their answer, and the correct answer. 

The quiz can be a standalone application or integrated into a larger Shiny application.

There is no built-in method for permanently recording users' answers in shinyquiz. By default, the package adheres to R Shiny's session data management. This means that user inputs and responses are held temporarily for the duration of the active session. Once the session ends – typically when the user closes the browser or the app is stopped – these inputs are not retained. If persistent data storage is required, such as for later analysis or record-keeping, users will need to implement their own data persistence logic. This might involve capturing the output of `quiz_server()` and saving responses to a database or writing them to a file.
